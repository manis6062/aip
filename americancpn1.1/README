--UPGRADE NOTES FROM SUNDAR (CODEIGNITER AND OTHER LIBRARIES)--

Upgrading from 2.0.2 to 2.0.3

Update Sessions Database Tables
If you are using database sessions with the CI Session Library, please update your ci_sessions database table as follows:
CREATE INDEX last_activity_idx ON ci_sessions(last_activity); ALTER TABLE ci_sessions MODIFY user_agent VARCHAR(120);

Upgrading from 2.1.0 to 2.1.1


Step 3: Update your IP address tables:
This upgrade adds support for IPv6 IP addresses. In order to store them, you need to enlarge your ip_address columns to 45 characters. For example, CodeIgniter's session table will need to change:
ALTER TABLE ci_sessions CHANGE ip_address ip_address varchar(45) default '0' NOT NULL

Upgrading to 3.0

The table structure has changed a bit, and more specifically:

        session_id field is renamed to id
        user_agent field is dropped
        user_data field is renamed to data and under MySQL is now of type BLOB
        last_activity field is renamed to timestamp
